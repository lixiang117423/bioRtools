\usage{
lm_analysis(
  data,
  x,
  y,
  group,
  color,
  alpha = 0.05,
  conf.level = 0.95,
  method = "lm",
  se = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame containing all variables needed for the analysis.
Must include the variables specified in x, y, group, and color parameters}

\item{x}{Character string specifying the column name for the independent
variable (predictor). This variable will be plotted on the X-axis and
used as the predictor in linear regression models}

\item{y}{Character string specifying the column name for the dependent
variable (response). This variable will be plotted on the Y-axis and
used as the response in linear regression models}

\item{group}{Character string specifying the column name for the grouping
variable. Separate linear regression models will be fitted for each
unique level of this variable}

\item{color}{Character string specifying the column name for point colors
in the scatter plot. Often the same as the group variable but can be
different to show additional data dimensions}

\item{alpha}{Significance level for regression p-values (default: 0.05).
Used to determine statistical significance in the results summary}

\item{conf.level}{Confidence level for regression confidence intervals
(default: 0.95). Used in both statistical calculations and plot confidence bands}

\item{method}{Regression method for line fitting (default: "lm" for linear model).
Can also be "glm", "gam", "loess", or other methods supported by ggplot2::geom_smooth}

\item{se}{Logical indicating whether to display confidence intervals around
regression lines in the plot (default: TRUE)}
}
\value{
A named list containing two elements:
  \describe{
    \item{\code{regression_results}}{Data frame with group-wise regression statistics:
      \itemize{
        \item \code{group}: Group levels from the grouping variable
        \item \code{n_observations}: Number of observations in each group
        \item \code{r_squared}: Coefficient of determination (R²)
        \item \code{adj_r_squared}: Adjusted R-squared
        \item \code{slope}: Regression slope (effect of x on y)

\description{
This function performs linear regression analysis between two continuous variables
within each level of a grouping variable. It calculates regression statistics
(R-squared, p-values, coefficients) for each group separately and creates an
integrated scatter plot with fitted regression lines. This is particularly
useful for comparing relationships across different experimental conditions,
species, treatments, or other categorical groupings.
}
\details{
For each group, the function fits a linear regression model: y ~ x and extracts:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{R-squared}: Proportion of variance in y explained by x
  \item \strong{Adjusted R-squared}: R² adjusted for degrees of freedom
  \item \strong{Slope}: Rate of change in y per unit change in x
  \item \strong{P-values}: Statistical significance of slope and overall model
  \item \strong{Confidence intervals}: Uncertainty bounds for slope estimates
}

The visualization combines all groups in a single plot for easy comparison
of regression relationships across groups.
}
\note{
\itemize{
  \item Both x and y variables should be continuous (numeric)
  \item Each group should have at least 3 observations for reliable regression
  \item The function assumes linear relationships; check residual plots for model validity
  \item Groups with insufficient data will generate warnings
  \item Consider data transformation if relationships appear non-linear

# Example 1: Basic regression analysis with iris data
data(iris)

# Analyze relationship between sepal length and width by species
results <- lm_analysis(
  data = iris,
  x = "Sepal.Length",
  y = "Sepal.Width",
  group = "Species",
  color = "Species"
